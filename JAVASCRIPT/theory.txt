what is javascript ? 
----------------------------
javascript is a most popular , object based programing or scripting language.

javascript mainly use for create interactive web pages. 

---------------------------------
why javascript ?

----------------------------------
using of html we can create structure of webpages 

<html>
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
</html>

using of css we can add styles on webpages. 

<h1 style="color:blue">hello users !</h1>

using of javascript we can handle behaviour of web pages. 

e.g.  on button click we can change any style or webpage 
========================================================
history of javascript 
=======================================================
earlier in 1995 netscape (old web browser company) wants to build interactive webpages 
so, they want to create one scripting language. 

A programmer - brendan Eich he created javascript within 10days only.

intially it was know as mocha , then livescript then they change it as 

javascript (because at that time java programing language is much popular)

but both are different language java and javascript

    tea != teacher 
    car != carpet

in 1997 they hand over javascript to ECMA company 

(European Computer Manufacturing Association) - then after they change is ES (Ecma Script)

e.g.  ES6 javascript 

Es6 launch in 2015 - at that time they introduce let , const and many more thing. 
=======================================
there are 3 ways to run javascript programs 

1) create html file and embedd js in <style> tag

2) create .js file and run with node 

    e.g.   node <filename>

3) open browser -> inspect -> console

        e.g.  console.log("hello")

===========================================
variables : Variable is a name which can store a value. 

    in javascript there are 3 ways to declare variable. 

    1) var 
    2) let 
    3) const 

1) var : var is launch earlier javascript. 

        var is use in old javascript. 

        var is a function based scope 

        which we can use inside the function only. 

        using of var keyword we can declare variable. 

        we can re-declare and we can redefine , update values.   

2) let : 
        let which newly launch in ES6 

        let which is use in block only. 

        we can update it but we can't re-declare in same block. 

        using of let keyword we can create variable. 

3) const : 

        const which use to make variable constant 

        so, we can't change it value after declaration. 

        using of const keyword we can declare const variable. 

===============================================================
prompt : prompt function in javascript 

    using of prompt we can accept value from user at run time 

    it is same like input() function in python. 

    by default prompt function accept value in string format. 

    syntax : 

        prompt("prompt message")


    prompt is a run dialog box which accept value from browser 

==========================================================
type casting : to convert one data type value into another data type its called type casting.

        for example 

        convert string value into integer there are different ways to achieve this type 
        casting. 

        Number("strvalue")

        but it will return NaN when string does not able to convert in numeric format 
        


parseInt : using of parseInt we can completely convert string into int. 

    
========================================================
Function : Function is a block of code . 
        that block we can call anywhere anytime. 
        using of function we can reduce our code. 

        using of function we can save time. 

        in javascript using of function keyword we can create a function. 
syntax : 

function  <funname>(){

}
